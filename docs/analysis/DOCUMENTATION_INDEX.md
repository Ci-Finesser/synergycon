## ✨ Key Points to Remember

1. **You have everything you need** - All specs are documented and detailed
2. **Start small** - Partner Management first (simplest, highest ROI)
3. **Follow the order** - Dependencies require: Partner → Speaker → Schedule
4. **Use the code examples** - They're in the GitHub issues, use them as templates
5. **Track with GitHub** - Create issues, use project board, track progress
6. **Automate emails** - Make that Phase 4 or 5, essential for operations
7. **Test thoroughly** - Use acceptance criteria to verify each feature
8. **Launch incrementally** - Can go live with Partner + Speaker + minimal schedule
